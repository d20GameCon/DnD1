# DROGE MORNINGLIGHT

Droge is a cousin to Yrind Morninglight, leader of the Caerilcarn, the Council of the Wood. Droge is a member of the Fellowship of the Forgotten flower -- an order of Corellon dedicated to retrieving ancient Elven artifacts -- and a worshiper of Corellon. Secretly, he's also a worshiper of Shevarash, the demipower of vengeance. Droge carries a rage within him about the fall of Earalann; he's a zealot. He wants to reestablish Earalann by any means necessary. Droge is Lawful Evil, holding carefully to the tenants of Corellon but with a dark side not present in the deity. He is explicitly racist toward Drow, Orcs, and demons of all sorts. He's not above working with them, but he doesn't hide his prejudice unless it's really important. Secretly, Droge is a racist toward all non-Tel-quessir races (non-Elves).

Droge was part of an expedition sent from the Lady of the Wood to find the Seven Mantle Stones of Eaerlann, said to be able to create a powerful mythal. The Lady of the Wood had a vision that the stones would be found in the land of Chult, in a great tomb of the gods. The all-Wood Elf expedition included two wizards, a paladin of Corellon, and two fighters. Droge is all that remains of the expedition, the others succumbing to pirate raids and disease. Siraye Aralen, a wizard whom Droge loved, was one of the leaders of the expedition. At one point, Droge was cast into the sea by pirates, drifted for days, and had a vision or hallucinated that Shevarash was protecting him and would ensure his eventual success. Picked up by merchants, he landed somewhere in Chult near Fort Beluarian and hired himself out as a mercenary until he was ready to resume the quest.

## Notes
He has none of his original equipment, having acquired gear and supplies in Chult while working as a mercenary for the last year.

DM:
> "this is good, i believe maybe Droge and his party were originally attacked by one of the same three pirate ships that have been plaguing the Chultan waters for almost a year now. The ship's flag was that of an eye against a field of emerald green. The captain could have been spotted wearing a glittering coat of gemstones with a gem encrusted scimitar at his belt and the heads of his most recent victims hanging from the ship's mermaid figurine."

Some of Droge's comrades, then, had been hanging from the ship, including Siraye Aralen, a wizard whom Droge loved, one of the leaders of the expedition.

The elves of Droge's expedition were, I imagine, deemed too dangerous to impress into service. They were slain or thrown overboard as a lesson to others.

DM:
> "as a mercenary you would have been smart enough to make your way to Fort Beluarian to obtain a charter of exploration? Commander Liara Portyr caught wind of your presence and hired you out to follow a set of large non-native tracks discovered south of the Iron Mines. She wants to know what made these tracks and what, if any, threat they pose to the Flaming Fist. You made your way through the jungle along the base of the mountains (same path the party has taken) and arrived at the mines to be greeted none too politely by the dwarven contingent there led by old Duriol Diamondbeard of Mirabar. Alas, and much to Duriol's chagrin, Miss Portyr has granted you safe passage and so it is there you stay the night. The following morning, another group of adventurers arrives...led by a 7' tall Chultan guide named Shago. From inside the courtyard of the mine's outer walls you watch as Duriol heartily receives Shago and his strange looking company..."

Addendum to Droge's background story: for most of the last year, Droge worked as an enforcer for the Merchant Princes of Nyanzaru. He was recently sent to Beluarian to try to infiltrate the Flaming Fist, discovering information about trade routes, about the pirates, and anything else useful to the Merchant Princes. He hasn't gotten far in his plot to inliftrate the Flaming Fist, only now coming to the attention of Liara Portyr. To further his personal agenda, Droge has been pursuing rumours of the mythical city of Umu, which he believes may be connected to the Lady of the Wood's vision about the lost Seven Mantle Stones of Earalann, fabled among the elves to enable creation of a powerful mythal over a forested area. Droge is happy to have gained some measure of trust from Liara Porty, but he views the mission to discover the origin of the tracks south of the Iron Mine to be a distract.

Droge mainly worships Rillifane Rallathil and Shevarash, and Corellon only secondarily.
Droge has met with [Eldreth Veluuthra](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Eldreth_Veluuthra)
Droge has the symbol tattooed to his right arm. Droge is a member of an Eldreth Veluuthra cell.

The Eldreth Veluuthra cell is a small secret society -- only a handful of members -- within Nordaaheril, Droge's home. His cousin, Yrind Morninglight, doesn't know about it and wouldn't approve.  The Caerilcarn in general is tolerant of humans.
