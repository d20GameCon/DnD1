# VALFEIN FRETH (Val)

Val is a Half-Drow, Half-Moon Elf. He practices roguery and the Way of the Shadow in honor of Vhaeraun, the Masked Lord. Val is the son of Vuzlyn Freth, a noble of House Freth who was slain in a slave revolt against Lolth. Val is in his second century. Strangely, he has recently started to experience the Remembrance. The memories of his previous life as an elf are disturbing to Val, who identifies mainly with his Drow family.

## OTHER IDEAS
  * Val is also bound to service of the Maiden of the Moon through a warlock pact
    - The Maiden of the Moon is an unusual patron. She does not seek power of any sort, and she only ever employs a single warlock at a time. Warlocks of the Maiden always have the same tragic tale. They were at one time betrothed to a woman of surpassing beauty, and they loved that woman with all their heart. On the night of the warlock and his beloved's wedding, the Maiden would appear and snatch the beloved away. Shortly after, the future warlock's life comes crashing down. Home, family, friends, and finally the warlock himself all perish. The Maiden then appears to the unfortunate soul, and offers him a chance to win back his wife. Those that accept become her warlocks, returning to life and being unable to die until their beloved is rescued. More often these broken wanderers are utterly destroyed, and their beloved joins the Maiden's court forevermore.
